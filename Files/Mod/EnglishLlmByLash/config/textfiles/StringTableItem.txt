Final00_00	Illusion
Final00_01	Accompanied by the broadcaster's indifferent voice,
Final00_02	The cold, large screen seemed like a diversion between major news broadcasts
Final00_03	They temporarily inserted a broadcast about your disappearance
Final00_04	No one knows you disappeared into some distant world
Final00_05	Even if your family and friends try every means to help,
Final00_06	After searching for years, there is still no news from you
Final00_07	Time flies like an arrow, and everything has changed as the stars shift
Final00_08	In the end, it was inevitable that people gradually forgot about your existence
Final00_09	What remains, perhaps, is only that when your name is mentioned,
Final00_10	A sigh was emitted
#结局01	
Final01_00	Like an arrow returning to its heart
Final01_01	Just as in every good story, there is virtue rewarded and vice punished
Final01_02	Even if it is according to custom, the evil intent from behind that reaches out to you in the end,
Final01_03	You cannot stop your determination to go home
Final01_04	This journey, although an unexpected interlude for you,
Final01_05	But it will awaken you at a future moment
Final01_06	Blaming the heavens and people, the fate of abandoning one's current life
Final01_07	How it will ultimately be
Final01_08	You shook your head, setting aside the heavy thoughts,
Final01_09	Looking at the friends who have fought alongside you on this journey,
Final01_10	Smiling, he waved goodbye
Final01_11	Though it is said that Jincheng is pleasant, there's no place like home
Final01_12	With a mix of excitement and apprehension in his heart,
Final01_13	You once again stepped through the doors of the Holy Sanctuary, which felt both familiar and strange
Final01_14	This time, what awaits you in front is,
Final01_15	It will be a warm home
Final01_16	Or perhaps it will be another new adventure?
#结局 02	
Final02_00	Heart of a Lifetime

Final02_02	Old man who constantly avoids reality
Final02_03	The illusory beauty he pursued could not free him from his bleak reality
Final02_04	That is your future you refuse to submit to
Final02_05	It is also a mirror that you cannot let go of
Final02_06	Life is full of beauty
Final02_07	But it will never appear in front of people who don't easily give up
Final02_08	You only need to do one thing
Final02_09	It's just about bringing the old man in front of us back
Final02_10	Rekindle our determination to strive for a beautiful life together
Final02_11	Return home, no matter how bitter reality is,
Final02_12	Go forward bravely, and write your own life story!
Final02_13	Who said life won't offer a second chance?
Final02_14	There's still a stream flowing in front of the door, why sing about gray hair and yellow chicken?

Final03_03	You coldly scanned the friends on the ground who had once stood with you in the same line-up
Final03_04	Limbs scattered here and there, the bodies were in pieces
Final03_05	Everyone is telling you about their past foolishness
Final03_06	It was you who told yourself
Final03_07	It should not be restricted by foolish humanity and morality anymore
Final03_08	Let the power that came into your hands slip away from before you
Final03_09	Looking back at the stranger yet familiar you, they exchanged smiles with each other
Final03_10	From now on, you two will walk together
Final03_11	Create an ideal future that belongs only to you
Final03_12	In that moment, you felt even more certain that you had chosen the right path
Final03_13	Exactly：When the tide came up the Zhejiang River, I finally knew who I was today!
#结局 04	
Final04_00	Wolf's Fierce Ambition

Final04_02	That one lying in the pool of blood, you, was right about something
Final04_03	Power should not be wasted
Final04_04	Therefore, it should be used to seize even greater power
Final04_05	'The future is said to be so ugly, why not let it be forgotten?'
Final04_06	Look at this heap of broken spears and shattered halberds, mountains of corpses and seas of blood,
Final04_07	This is the power you have to change the world
Final04_08	You will use this force to transform illusion into a brand-new future
Final04_09	No one can stop your desire and intention
Final04_10	That ideal realm hidden within your heart,
Final04_11	It is already within reach, just a spit away!
