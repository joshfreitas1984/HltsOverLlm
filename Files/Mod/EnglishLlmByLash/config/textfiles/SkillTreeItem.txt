it30720	Classic of the Northern Abyss	it30720	There is a fish in the Northern Ocean, and its name is Kun. The size of Kun is so vast that it spans thousands of miles beyond measure. This phenomenon arises naturally as when all rivers flow into the sea, making it vast by containing them all. Consequently, it can absorb the inner force of others for its own use.

They cultivate a stance of stillness on the ice, then leap across melting patches at the moment it thaws, mastering a highly nimble lower-body technique that remains unburdened even as their feet do not get wet or touched by a single flake of snow for hours. When practicing leg techniques during snowfall days, practitioners kick snowflakes away and can remain untouched by swirling snow around them; the most skilled among them can kick continuously for several hours amidst waves without dampening their toes or getting snow on any part of their body.
