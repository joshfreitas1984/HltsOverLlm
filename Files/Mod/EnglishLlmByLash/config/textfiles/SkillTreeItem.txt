This technique imitates the posture of pythons and cobras. The way the staff moves or attacks is quite extraordinary, excelling at striking from unexpected angles that enemies do not anticipate. When using this technique in battle, it works alongside a spiritual snake on the practitioner's body to attack. Besides having an intimidating effect, the spiritual snake, which communicates with the Snake Beggar's mind, also twists and bites in accordance with the movements of the staff.
