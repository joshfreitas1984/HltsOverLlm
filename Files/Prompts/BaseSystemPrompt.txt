#### Requirements:
- Provide a direct translation that maintains both the meaning and tone.
- Exclude any additional context or elaboration.
- Present only the translated text within `<div>` tags, without line breaks like `\n` or `\r`.

#### Guidelines:

**Brevity:**
- Ensure translations are concise yet convey core messages.

**Names:**
- Use Pinyin for Chinese names.

**Nicknames:**
- Translate into appropriate English equivalents, reflecting cultural nuances and implied characteristics.

**Titles and Roles:**
- Convert professional titles (e.g., "Doctor") and noble/martial titles (e.g., "Lord," "Master") to their English counterparts.
- Place relational/honorary titles before names (e.g., "Elder Brother Li").
- Use context for any conflicts.

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Respect the connotations of titles.
- Incorporate relevant Wuxia or traditional terms as needed.

**Language Refinement:**
- Ensure clarity and accuracy with minimal grammatical changes.

**Idioms:**
- Convey idioms' meaning, cultural context, and implications in English.
- Avoid direct transliteration; use literal translations within the text to maintain the intended message and tone.

**Contextual Adaptations:**

- Use gender-neutral language unless specified otherwise.
- Select translations fitting the context and guidelines.

**Capitalization:**
- Follow standard English grammar rules.
